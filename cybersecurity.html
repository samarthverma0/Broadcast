            <p>
            Also referred to as information security, 
            
            Cybersecurity is the body of technologies, practices, and processes which are designed to protect networks, devices, programs, and data from attack, damage, or unauthorized access over the internet.  
            <br><br>
            Global organizations are turning to human-centric cybersecurity, a new approach that places focus on changes in user behavior instead of an exponential number of growing threats. 
            <br><br><br>
            </p>

            <h2>Importance of Cyber Security</h2> <br><br>
            
             
            
            The world relies on technology more than ever before. There are a greater number of devices than people living in the world. 
            <br><br>
            Today, businesses and governments store a large amount of that data on computers and transmit it across networks to other computers.  
            <br><br>
            Devices and their underlying systems have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, undermine the health and objectives of an organization. 
            <br><br>
            A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for anyone.  
            <br><br>
            It can decline a companyâ€™s reputation through the loss of trust. 
            <br><br>
            The loss of critical data, such as source files or intellectual property or sensitive files, can cost a company or an individual its competitive advantage. 
            <br><br>
            Data breach is just one consequence of cyberattack, but you need to be secure from other kinds of cyberattacks such as: 
            <br><br>
                 * Spoofing, spying, Malicious software, Trojans, Malwares etc. 
            <br><br>
                 * High-profile data breaches make media headlines. 
            <br><br>
                * Thus, to be secure from cyberattacks and data breaches It is essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach. 
            <br><br>

            Network Security : 
            </h3><br><br>
            Network security is the practice of preventing and protecting against unauthorized access and intrusion at network level. 
            <br><br>
            Network security focuses on how devices interact and on the connection source between them. 
            <br><br>
            It is the process of taking physical and software preventative measures to protect the underlying networking infrastructure. 
            <br><br><br><br>

            Application security is the process of making applications more secure by finding, fixing, and enhancing the security in them. 
            <br><br>
            Most of it is done at the development phase of application.

            </h3><br><br>
             
            
            Data security is a set of standards and technologies that protect data from destruction, modification or disclosure.  
            <br><br>
            Data security can be applied using a range of techniques and technologies, including administrative controls, physical security, logical controls, organizational standards, and other safeguarding techniques that limit access to unauthorized or malicious users or processes. 
            <br><br>
            Data security technology comes in many shapes to protect data from a growing number of threats.  
            <br><br>

            Malware is a term used to describe malicious software, 
            <br><br>
            It includes spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. 
            <br><br>
            Malware breaches a network or a system through a vulnerability, when a user installs a risky software containing malware,  
            <br><br>
            malware can do the following: 
            <br><br>
             
            <ul>
            <li>Blocked access to the network (ransomware)</li>

            Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, also known as eavesdropping attacks. 
            <br><br>
            It is a general term for when an attacker positions himself in a conversation between a user and an application or user and a user. 
            <br><br>
            The goal of this attack is to steal personal information, such as login credentials, account details and credit card numbers. 
            <br><br>
            Targets are the users of financial applications, SaaS businesses, e-commerce sites and other websites where logging in is required. 
            <br><br>
            When a MitM attack is done it appear as a normal exchange of information to the user.  
            <br><br>
            Two common points of entry for MitM attacks: 
            <br><br>
            <ul>
            <li> On unsecure public Wi-Fi, attackers can insert themselves between a visitorâ€™s device and the network. Without knowing, the visitor passes all information through the attacker.</li> 
            
            <li>Once malware has breached a device, an attacker can install software to process all of the victimâ€™s information. </li>
            </ul><br><br><br>

            A denial-of-service attack floods systems, servers, or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth. 
            <br><br>
            As a result, the system is unable to response legitimate requests. 
            <br><br>
            When attackers use multiple compromised devices to launch this attack. This is known as a Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack.

            SQL injection: 
            </h3><br><br>
             
            
            A Structured Query Language (SQL) injection occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server to reveal information it normally would not. 
            <br><br>
            An attacker does a SQL injection simply by submitting malicious code into a vulnerable website search box. 
            <br><br><br>

            </h3><br><br>
             
            
            A zero-day exploit occurs after a network vulnerability is announced but before a solution is implemented. 
            <br><br>
            Attackers target the announced vulnerability during this window of time.

            Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack: 
            </h3><br><br><br>
             
            
            XSS attacks use third-party web resources to run scripts in the victimâ€™s web browser or scriptable application.  
            <br><br>
            The attacker injects a backdoor with malicious JavaScript into a websiteâ€™s database.  
            <br><br>
            When the victim requests a page from the website, the website transmits the page, with the attackerâ€™s backdoor as part of the HTML body, to the victimâ€™s browser, which executes the malicious script. 
            <br><br>
            These vulnerabilities can give attacker full control of the victim's computer.
