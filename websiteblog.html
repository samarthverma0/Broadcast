        <h1 style="color: #2bebc6;">What is a website?</h1><br><br>

<p> To say in a line a website is simply - “a set of related web pages located under a single domain name”</p>

<p>Think of a website as a book and each individual page is a web page containing some information.</p>

<p>•    A website is typically a collection of web pages, images and other elements that are linked together to form a larger and structured document. 
<br><br>
•	A website can be made up of a single page or it could constitute thousands of pages.
<br><br>
•	Each page has its own text, images and other elements.</p>

<br><br>

<h1 style="color: #2bebc6;"> The Basics of a Website</h1>
<br><br>
<img class="imagi" src="images/blog/domain.jpg" alt=""> <br><br>


<p> Making website or web applications (an application working on a website) is referred to as Web Development. <br><br>

To understand how a website is made, let’s take a look at the very basics of how websites work. <br><br>

Every single website on the Internet requires just two things to work. <br>
That’s right. Just two. <br>
They are: <br><br>

* Domain name. This is the unique URL name for your website typically followed by a .com, .org,. online, etc. <br><br>

* Web host. This is where your website “lives.” It’s the servers you use to store your website’s information. <br><br>

    Combined, these two things allow your website to simply exist on the Internet.</p> <br><br>


 
<h1 style="color: #2bebc6;">What does a website consist of ?</h1> <br><br>
<img class="imagi" src="images/blog/fn-bn.jpg" alt=""> <br><br>

<p><h3>A website has 3 parts: </h3>  <br><br>

<h4> Front-End: </h4><br><br>
•	If you are a visitor(user) to a website the part of the website which you can access and interact with is called as the frontend. <br><br>
•	A user interacts with the Front-End of the website and perform various activities and the functions the website has. <br><br>
•	The Front-End has a Graphical User Interface / GUI to make it easy for a user to interact. <br><br>
•	Front-end is the client side of the website. <br><br>
•	For example – www.youtube.com has a user-friendly UI design which makes it simpler to use. <br><br><br>

<h4>The Fornt-End of a website has 3 parts: </h4><br><br>

<h5>For presenting text – HTML or PHP, </h5><br><br>
•	HTML also known as HyperText Markup Language and PHP(Hypertext Preprocessor) are widely used languages for scripting text on a website. <br><br><br>

<h5>For Stylizing a Website – CSS, </h5> <br><br>
•	CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) primarily handles the look and feel of a Website. <br><br>
•	For example – Hover Effects, adding awesome fonts and colors, some visual graphics, etc. <br><br><br>

<h5>  For increasing Interactivity – JavaScript, </h5> <br><br>
•	JavaScript provides interactivity to a webpage, handle complex functions and features to increase functionality. <br><br>
•	For example – submission of a form on a button click, Selection of only one option at a time. <br><br><br>



<h4> Back-End: </h4><br><br>
•	Back-end Development refers to the server-side development. <br><br>
•	It is the term used for the behind-the-scenes  activities that happen when performing any action on a website. <br><br>
•	Backend developer focuses on databases, scripting, and the architecture of websites. <br><br><br>


<h4> Back-End of a website can be build with the help of Web Framework of any Language, like: </h4><br><br>

•	PHP, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Java, Rust, C#, and many more programming languages are used. <br><br><br>

<h4> Database: </h4><br><br>

•	The database is the storage unit. <br><br>
•	The actual data and content of a website remains stored in a Database. <br><br>
•	The data is stored in a arranged and systemtic manner. <br><br>
•	Example – MySQL, Oracle, DB2Postgres, etc. are some of the DBMS(Database Management System) used for storing data. <br><br></p><br> 


<h1 style="color: #2bebc6;">How to make one …</h1> <br><br>
<img class="imagi" src="images/blog/unp.jpg" alt=""> <br><br>

<p><h3> To construct a website, we have many contrasting ways and resources:</h3> <br><br>

•	If you have the sufficient knowledge, skills and time needed build one for yourself and customize it as you want. <br><br>

•	If you don’t have the prior knowledge reqiured to make a website, make an active try on online website builders like WordPress, Wix, and many more.<br><br>

•	Contact a Web Developer. <br><br>

•	There are many websites, you can check out and hire a developer for your website. Some of them are – www.refrens.com, www.upwork.com, etc. They provide freelance services. <br><br><br>

<h4> For different Programming Languages we have many different types of frameworks to build a fully functional website. </h4> <br><br>
Each Framework has its own advantages and disadvantages over the other. <br><br>

On the basis of requirement we can choose suitable Programming Language and its Web Framework. <br><br>

Examples: Python popular Frameworks: <br><br>
   		Django CMS,  Flask,  Web2py,  etc. <br><br>

           JavaScript: <br><br>
AngularJS,  Jquery,  Express.JS,  Underscore.JS,  etc. <br><br>

Java: <br><br>
Vaadin,  Grails,  etc. <br><br>


In this article we have just tried to give a brief just descreption of what a site is and what is a basic working of a Website.
The field of Web-Devlopment is preety much vast,
Keep exploring it… <br><br><br><br></p>
